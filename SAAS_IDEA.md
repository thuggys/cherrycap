# CodeGuard - AI Code Reviewer That Actually Knows Your Codebase

## The Problem

AI code assistants (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, etc.) generate code that:
- Hallucinates functions that don't exist
- Ignores existing solutions already in your codebase
- Creates duplicate utilities/helpers
- Uses patterns that conflict with your team's standards
- Suggests code with known issues (documented in GitHub issues)
- Works now but breaks later (anti-patterns, deprecated methods)

**Result:** Developers waste hours debugging AI-generated code, creating tech debt, and reinventing wheels that already exist in their codebase.

## The Solution

CodeGuard is a code review tool that:
1. Indexes your entire codebase (functions, patterns, utilities)
2. Monitors GitHub issues for known problems/anti-patterns
3. Validates AI-generated code against your actual codebase
4. Catches duplicates, hallucinations, and anti-patterns
5. Suggests the "your team's way" to solve the problem

## How It Works

### Example 1: Duplicate Detection
```javascript
// AI suggests this:
function validateEmail(email) {
  return /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
}

// CodeGuard catches:
❌ Duplicate: validateEmail() already exists in src/lib/validators.ts:12
❌ Pattern mismatch: Your codebase uses Zod for all validation
❌ Known issue: GitHub #234 - Regex validation fails on unicode emails
✅ Suggested fix: import { emailSchema } from '@/lib/validators'
```

### Example 2: Hallucinated Functions
```javascript
// AI suggests:
const data = await convex.db.delete(id);

// CodeGuard catches:
❌ Hallucination: convex.db.delete() doesn't exist in convex@1.12.0
❌ Pattern: Your codebase uses ctx.db.delete() in mutations
✅ Correct method: await ctx.db.delete(args.id)
✅ Reference: See convex/users.ts:45 for example usage
```

### Example 3: Anti-Pattern Detection
```javascript
// AI suggests:
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);

// CodeGuard catches:
⚠️  Anti-pattern: Missing cleanup for async operations
⚠️  GitHub issue #567: Race conditions with unmounted components
✅ Team pattern: Use React Query (see src/hooks/useData.ts)
✅ Or: Add AbortController cleanup (see src/hooks/useFetch.ts)
```

## Competitive Advantage

### vs. ESLint/Prettier
- They enforce style, we enforce patterns
- We understand your specific codebase
- We catch library-specific hallucinations
- We integrate with GitHub issues

### vs. SonarQube
- We're AI-code-gen focused
- Faster, simpler setup
- Better developer experience
- Lower cost for small teams

### vs. GitHub Copilot
- We validate their output
- We know your codebase, they don't
- We prevent issues, they create them
- Complementary, not competitive

## Metrics to Track

### Product Metrics
- Issues caught per scan
- False positive rate
- Time saved per developer
- Tech debt prevented (estimated $)
- Patterns learned per codebase

### Business Metrics
- Free → Paid conversion rate
- Churn rate
- MRR growth
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- LTV (Lifetime Value)

### User Metrics
- Daily active users
- Scans per user
- Repositories added
- Team invites sent
- Feature usage

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: AI models improve, problem goes away
**Mitigation:** Focus on codebase-specific patterns, not just hallucinations. Even perfect AI won't know YOUR team's conventions.

### Risk 2: Too many false positives
**Mitigation:** Learning mode that improves over time. Allow users to mark false positives. Team pattern learning.

### Risk 3: Privacy concerns (scanning code)
**Mitigation:** Self-hosted option. SOC 2 compliance. Code never stored, only indexed locally. Open source core.

### Risk 4: GitHub/VS Code builds this feature
**Mitigation:** Move fast, build community. They're slow. Focus on patterns, not just linting. Offer self-hosted.

- AST parsing (learn as you go)
- Vector embeddings (OpenAI API, simple)
- Basic ML concepts (optional for MVP)

## Why This Will Work

1. **Real problem you experienced** - Not theoretical
2. **AI code gen is growing** - Problem gets bigger
3. **Teams will pay** - Saves time = worth money
4. **Technical moat** - Requires deep parsing/indexing
5. **Network effects** - Better with more code indexed
6. **Solves pain daily** - Devs hit this constantly

## Why You Can Build This

1. You know the problem firsthand
2. You have the technical skills
3. You understand the developer workflow
4. You've built complex features (raffle system, Convex integration)
5. You're resourceful (figured out legal stuff, deployment, etc.)

## Final Thought

Most SaaS ideas fail because they solve problems nobody has. This solves a problem YOU have, that's getting worse as AI code gen grows. 

Start small (just duplicate detection), validate quickly, iterate based on real usage. If 10 developers would pay $10/month for it, you have something.

The best time to build this was 6 months ago. The second best time is now.

Let's fucking build it.
